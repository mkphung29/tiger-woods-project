                    <h2>Sensationalized Since Childhood</h2>
                    <p>The ways in which Tiger presented himself to the media especially
                         early on in his career is heavily influenced by Earl Woods.
                          During his childhood, Earl aimed to separate Tiger's image from
                           the normal perception of black golfers, emphasizing Tiger's
                            privileged upbringing and exceptional talent in a feature spread
                             in Ebony, "this is one of the first Black golfers with natural
                              skills whose parents have the means to get pro instructions that
                               even exceed those afforded to Jack Nicklaus in his formative years."
                                Earl's portrayal of Tiger's exceptionalism in his early years
                                 immediately attracted the golf world, a world that hoped to find
                                  a symbol of racial progress in the eyes of post-racial America.<br>
                        <br> Along with the great amount of media attention in Tiger's life, HBO Max's
                         Tiger documentary series claims that Earl put an immense amount of pressure
                          on Tiger to become a hero for the black community and likened his potential
                           accomplishments to be on par with the historical narrative of black civil rights.
                            "Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of humanity,"
                             Earl said, "he'll be bigger than Gandhi and Buddha...He is the Chosen One4". Earl's
                              talks about Tiger's blackness laid the foundation for sensationalized focus of his
                               black identity but perhaps more importantly, set up the erasure of Tiger's multiracialism
                                in the mainstream media.

                    <h2>Tiger On the Show "That's Incredible"</h2>
                    <p>The clip depicts a TV feature on Tiger woods as an incredible
                         golfer at five years-old. He has already become a media
                          sensation–when he was two, he appeared on "The Mike Douglas Show"
                           with his father. In the clip, the feature chooses to emphasize
                            Tiger's "knowledge of the game" and his strategy while a white
                             golf pro describes him as "an exceptional person." In accordance
                              to Ben Carrington's theories3 about the black athlete versus
                               the white athlete, stereotypical white descriptors praise the
                                young Tiger's intelligence over his natural athletic abilities,
                                 showcasing the early development of Tiger's hard work and work
                                  ethic since he started playing when he was one year old.<br>
                        <br>Earl's control over Tiger's image can also be seen, where in his interview
                         he reinforces these white descriptors by stressing Tiger's intelligence and work
                          ethic. Thus, he presents Tiger as a suitable little role model for portraying white
                           ideals that are admired in America.<br>
                        <br>The sequence where Tiger is practicing at a nice golf course surrounded by white
                         people plays up his middle-class status. His exceptional personality is stated so Tiger
                          is not infantilized like children his age, and it separates Tiger from stereotypical
                           black descriptors that evoke the image of black aggression.<br>
                        <br>Overall, Tiger's portrayal through white descriptors allows Earl and Tiger to cultivate
                         an image that appeals to white America while the constant attention towards Earl's insistence
                          about Tiger's potential racial impact on America allows white golfers to accept him more and
                           caters to their need for evidence of a post-racial America.

            <h2>Tiger's Early Racial Stance</h2>
            <p>Influenced by his father's racial visions for his life and career,
                 Tiger Woods publicly affirmed his identity as an African-American
                  golfer and acknowledged the racism that was still present in golf
                   and society at the time. At a young age, he knew that his presence
                    in golf and the implications of his racial identity were significant
                     to golf's racial history, but he believed that he would triumph over
                      racism by succeeding through his individual achievements rather than
                       directly confronting white supremacy in sports through words and actions.
                        Tiger emphasizes his blackness to meet everyone's expectations for him
                         to become the black trailblazer of his generation:

            <h2>Winning the 1997 Masters Tournament</h2>
            <p>Becoming the first black golfer to win the Masters in 1997 meant that there
                 was extra emphasis on how different parts of Tiger's racial identity should
                  be utilized. The tournament was a turning point in the way Tiger decided to
                   represent his racial identity. Now that he has achieved national stardom,
                    getting offered hefty sponsorships and appearing across the media, Tiger
                     no longer aspired to become a golfing pioneer for the black community
                     and transformed himself into a brand.

                          him to push back against Earl and assume control over his image.
                           "Tiger didn't want to be a messiah...Tiger didn't see himself
                            as the unifying force, that was Earl's dream. [Earl] didn't
                             realize the pressure that was placed on Tiger."<br>
                        <br>Tiger's interview garnered widespread support and criticism
                         across the country. People who supported him argued that he should
                          be able to identify as multiracial and affirm all parts of his racial
                           identity.<br>
                        <br>Critics, however, disparaged Tiger for not asserting his blackness
                         since he passes as a black man in America, and considered his comment
                          "a weak, immature, and even selfish response to classic white racism.<br>
                        <br>After the proclamation of his multiracial identity, Tiger would not
                         reaffirm a strong stance on multiracialism or his blackness and would
                          choose to remain apolitical and speak little on his race for fear of
                           backlash and interference with "the economics of his position"– "fan appeal,
                            endorsements, public appearances, the reception of his peers, and the golf
                             establishment, all challenge him to accept its culture."

            <h2>America's Colorblindness and Post Racial America</h2>
            <p>Earl's heavy media presence along with his mother Tida's minimal presence
                 in the media contributed to the carving of Tiger's early affirmations of
                  his blackness. Since Asian golfers mainly came from foreign countries and
                   were not of American nationalities, the media felt that it was easier to
                    focus strictly on the African-American part of his identity given America's
                     racial history with the black community. Woods's Asian and Native-American
                      heritage are not presented as distinct, equally-important parts of his identity
                       but are grouped together into a collective representation of Tiger's
                        multiracialism.<br>
                <br>White America utilizes different parts of his multiracial identity when they
                 best suit their narratives of colorblindness and of a post-racial America. When
                  he is compared to black NBA players, Tiger Woods is considered a "breath of fresh
                   air"–a statement that demonizes representations of African-American NBA players
                    who embody the tropes of the "black athlete" in terms of aggression and savagery.
                     Through his blackness, Woods is portrayed as a black man upholding White American
                      ideals that should be treated as the moral standard for black athletes, especially
                       for black basketball players that are charged with routinely violating national core
                        values. At the same time, his multiracialism is used to denounce the African-American
                         community for deviating from the familial and national traditional culture.<br>
                <br>In a study done by Andrew Billings from Clemson University, he wanted to determine how
                 implicit racial biases of sports commentators are demonstrated in tournament coverage of
                  Tiger Woods. Reviewing footage from the four major golf tournaments (Masters, US Open,
                   British Open, and PGA Championship) during the 2001 PGA season, Billings pinpointed
                    the common descriptor words used to describe Tiger's tournament play and compared
                     them to descriptors for other players in the field. Based on the results, Billings
                      concluded that when Tiger was playing well, his success was mostly attributed to his
                       experience, while in contrast, othe golfers were more likely to succeed because of
                        perceived athletic skill and composure. Conversely, when Tiger is playing poorly,
                         his failure is blamed on his lack of composure, frustration, and loss of concentration
                          significantly more than other golfers. The study demonstrates that Woods exhibits
                           stereotypes of both white and black athletes: when Woods is successful, the commentary
                            does not use traditional Black stereotypes. However, when Woods is failing, his struggles
                             are portrayed using black stereotypes, where his emotional intelligence and composure is
                              questioned.<br>
                <br>Woods's representation in broadcasting reveals how his performance is racialized to allow white
                 America's to claim his successes whenever it can while separating his failings from his white image
                  and finding ways to blame his blackness for the parts of him America doesn't want to see. The back
                   and forth shift between the black and white binaries of Tiger's representation also conflicts with
                    the utilization of his multiracialism to further promote America's colorblindness. Woods' multiracialism
                     is celebrated as an achievement of America's acceptance of a multicultural melting pot5, where
                      all races and cultures are supposedly given the opportunities to reach the same levels of
                       socioeconomic standing as everyone else. America's colorblindness causes the country to assign
                        itself a privileged and morally superior position. As Gary Smith, senior writer at Sports
                         Illustrated, explains when commentating on Tiger's success in American culture, "it was 
                         like White America patting itself on the back. Look, this is the promise that America makes.
                          That anyone can use the tools that this country offers and make it to the top regardless of
                           race, color, creed."<br>
                <br>Due to the backlash and the controversy caused by the "Cablinasian" interview, Tiger keeps a tight
                 lip around issues of race but when experiencing racial discrimination himself, he has attempted to
                 respond to these incidents in a manner that would please the public, but each decision he makes is
                  heavily scrunitized regardless of how he responded:

                    <h2>The Case of Fuzzy Zoeller</h2>
                    <div class="ZT-image">

                    <div class="ZT-info">
                        <p>In 1997, fellow PGA tour player Fuzzy Zoeller was
                             asked about his thoughts on Tiger after completing
                              his round at the Masters, saying:<br>
                        <br><em>"That little boy is driving well and he's putting well.
                         He's doing everything it takes to win. So you know what you
                          guys do when he gets in here? You pat him on the back and
                           say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not to serve
                            fried chicken next year....Or collard greens or whatever
                             the hell they serve."</em><br>
                        <br>While the backlash against Zoeller's comment was strong, Woods
                         offered no comment on his "racial joke" that Zoeller claimed to
                          make. Many used the incident to criticize his Woods's decision
                           to not affirm his blackness during the "Cablinasian" interview, 
                           arguing that Zoeller's comment is evidence that Tiger is seen by
                            the world as a black man, and despite Tiger's multiracialism,
                             his experiences racism as a black man. Tiger's lack of response 
                             to the incident was seen as him distancing himself from his
                              blackness and conversations about the black experience in
                               America.<br>
                        <br>On the contrary, others also criticized Woodss silence on the
                         issue because they claimed that he should've defended his fellow
                          player and not left him out to dry or his "harmless joke." The
                           thinly-veiled racism underlying these criticisms adhere to the
                            colorblind narratives of golf–these critics believed that because
                             there is integration in golf and that there is no blatant forms
                              of racism in present-day golf, there is no prevalent racist issues
                               that need to be addressed anymore, so they overlook the incident
                                or avoid conversations about the racism still entrenched on
                                 tour to uphold a post-racial vision of America.<br>
                        <br>The Cablinasian interview scared Woods into silence about racial
                         issues, with many people believing that Tiger doesn't contribute anything
                          meaningful to racial discussions, but now Woods faced harsh backlash for
                           his silence on Zoeller's comment and for not attempting to put out a statement
                            addressing the PGA tour's racial issues.

                    <div class="ZT-info">
                        <p> In early 2008, Golf Channel anchor Kelly Tilghman
                             joked that other players should "lynch" Woods in a
                              "back alley" if they hoped to win tournaments.<br>
                            <br>In this instance, Tiger Woods decided to quickly
                             release a statement, but instead of condemning Tilghman
                              for her racism, he called her comments a "non-issue"
                               and said that he knew there was "unequivocally...there
                                was no ill intent", in an effort to appease those who
                                 believe in golf's colorblind narrative.<br>
                            <br>Though he took a different approach to handle this
                             incident, his response is consistent with his pattern
                              of avoiding the polarized racial minefield of golf.
                               It also shows that any statement that Tiger makes will
                                likely set off new controversies, whether if he's being
                                 criticized by colorblind America for taking a hard
                                  stance on racial issues or being criticized by the black
                                   community for perpetuating a false notion that progress
                                    in golf, and by extension America, is complete and
                                     no more action is needed. <br>
                            <br>If golf, considered one of America's most white and elitist
                             sports has dealt with its segregation, has a variety of professional
                              black players, and has a black man dominating a traditionally
                               white sport, is there a need to do more in America? This attitude
                                echoes the post-racial fantasies of Americans who boast about
                                 the country's moral superiority. To them, America's ideals
                                  of freedom, democracy, and liberty as expressed through the
                                   opportunity given to Woods to have a successful golfing career
                                    due to America's benevolence towards reconciling with someone
                                     of Tiger's ethnicity to be on the tour. <br>
                            <br>Thus, Tiger portrays a racial image consistent with golf's elitist
                             history and beneficial for its desire for a suitable symbol of racial
                              progress.

            <h2>The Nike Ads: Reconstructing Tiger's Racial Identity</h2>
            <p>An important example of the manipulation of Tiger's racial image for certain
                 needs is Nike's role in taking advantage of the racial issues surrounding
                  Tiger's racial identity to project an aesthetic that it trail blazes,
                   represents American ideals, and appeals to different communities.
                    This meant overemphasizing on Tiger's blackness, disregarding the fact
                     that he is part white, and erasing the parts of his identity, the Asian
                      and Native American aspects, that don't align with the message Nike
                       wants to get across. For Tiger, conversations about race and his
                        blackness were only used to help his brand, not directly confront
                         racial issues in America.

                    <h2>"I Am Tiger Woods"</h2>
                    <p>As the first Tiger Woods TV campaign, "I am Tiger Woods" utilizes
                         Tiger's multiracialism to present him as the "new face of America".
                        Including a diverse set of children meant to represent Tiger's
                         African-American, Asian-American, and Caucasian heritage, the commercial
                          acts as a celebration of America's multiculturalism and racial progress.<br>
                        <br>Here, the portrayal of Tiger's multiracialism acts as evidence of a reformed
                         America that strays from its long history of racial discrimination. The clips
                          of different children holding golf clubs and bags, walking golf courses, and
                           hitting balls symbolizes what Woods's arrival on the PGA Tour means as a watershed
                            moment: Woods is an inspiration to the next wave of golfers and people envision
                             that the future golf tour will encompass a utopian-esque variety of different races
                              and hold greater diversity among its players.<br>
                        <br>Golf is characterized by the Nike commercial as having been democratized and a game
                         for the people, where children of any race or class can have access to the sport. However,
                          Tiger's own background contradicts this narrative because he became successful due to his
                           middle-class upbringing, where he had access to private country clubs, golf instruction,
                            and quality equipment that all can't be afforded by anyone. But because Woods attracted
                             millions of new fans to the PGA, especially many non-white fans, Nike attempts to connect
                              to this new target audience while gratifying white America's vision of the future generation.

                    <h2>"Hello World"</h2>
                    <p>Widely considered Tiger's most controversial ad campaign, 
                        Nike's "Hello World" commercial received much backlash
                         for Nike's opportunistic politics in playing the "race card".
                         Cole and Andrews define race-carding as:<br>
                         <!--Italicize quote below-->
                        <br> "a primary and explicit expression of the regulatory logic
                         that governs discourses around race in the USA...it implies that
                          the introduction of racial divisions is inappropriate and unfair.
                           Moreover, it implies that consciousness of race is itself an
                            obstacle to racial equality."<br>
                        <br>Nike's campaign strategy of race-carding was perceived by critics
                         as sidestepping critical reflection on national politics and instead,
                          capitalizing on racial narratives that white America loves to see–racial
                           progress being made at the center of sports.<br>
                        <br>In their attempts to reconcile with the growing numbers of non-white
                         people in America and their increased participation and representation
                          in sports, there was a fear that white people would soon become the new
                           minority and lose the ability to control racial power dynamics. Therefore,
                            Nike exploits this fear by aligning Tiger to American ideals of individualism,
                             colorblind meritocracy, masculinity, and proper citizenship. At a time
                              where increasing racial polarization, white America found a sense of
                               intimacy, pride, and reassurance in Tiger's image.<br>
                        <br>Along with the "I Am Tiger Woods" campaign, the commercial also characterized
                         Tiger as "innocent, pure, and virtuous"5, a victim of undeserving blatant racism
                          that most White Americans concede is enough to take action against. Illustrating
                           Tiger as a victim in turn characterizes him as an apolitical figure that doesn't
                            offend anyone with confrontational politics. Victimizing Woods gives Americans an
                             "underdog" figure to root for while simultaneously feeding into the superiority
                              complex associated with America's post-racial fantasies, where whites view
                               non-whites as a charitable cause and patronizing them.<br>
                        <br>Tiger Woods's perceived activism was authorized by a nation linked to "media,
                         family, and consumption" and gave people what they wanted to see.This "familiar"
                          and "heroic" narrative, "in which consumers participate in", was manufactured
                           "against the backdrop of an exceptional experience."<br>
                        <br>Nike focused on Tiger's blackness to tell a sensationalized racial storyline
                         akin to Jackie Robinson's, giving Americans the means to change or rewrite America's
                          black racial history on their own terms, through a white perspective, ignoring the
                           actual struggles of the community.

                    <h2>How Does The Portrayal of Tiger's Racial Identity Connect to Larger Themes of American Values and Consumerism?</h2>

                        <p>Early on, Tiger Woods, with the influence of his father, sought to be accepted by golf's establishment while
                             striving to enact social change on a broad scale. For the beginning of Tiger's career, there was a tension
                              between creating the illusion of racial progress in golf by emphasizing Tiger's blackness in the media and
                               using Woods as a representative of a minority figure aligned with white ideals. Tiger's multiracialism
                                became a tool to propagate a narrative supporting America's post-racialism and redirecting conversations
                                 away from addressing deeper racial issues underlying American society. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Everyone put high expectations on Tiger to become golf's spokesperson for the new wave of racial progressivism
                             within the sport but the amount of pressure that he faced for every decision he made caused him to step back from
                              the conversation as a whole. This brings into question whether Tiger should be obligated to address golf's racial
                               issues or if people have a right to look to him to enact social change and expect him to present his life and
                                career in the name of progress. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Tiger's success as a brand depends on the economics of a system (the golf industry) that relies on its status
                             and symbol of white prestige to encourage the consumption of media, merchandise, etc. from its main consumers–wealthy
                              or middle-class people who can afford to play and watch golf. The actions (or lack thereof) that Tiger takes towards
                               confronting serious racial issues in golf impacts his image among the industry's target consumers which affects the
                                amount of wealth and recognition he receives from brand deals, public appearances, and fans. Indeed, Tiger has chosen
                                 to protect the socioeconomic landscape of the sport for his own while sacrificing respect from the communities 
                                 represented through his multiracial identity.
