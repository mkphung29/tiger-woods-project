# The Image of Tiger Woods

This was my final research project for my Sports, Race, and Politics course at NYU. The Image of Tiger Woods is a website that explores Tiger Woods' career and challenges through a racial and cultural lens. It was coded using HTML and CSS.

Each page displays different parts of my analysis, which includes:

-History: Golf's racial history with African-Americans

-Racial Identity: How the portrayals of Woods' racial identity have been changed and shaped over time

-Celebrity Status: The impact of Woods' celebrity status on portrayals of his race

-Legacy: Offers a concluding thought to Tiger's legacy as a multi-racial golfer and diversity on the PGA Tour

-Bibliography: Sources for research
