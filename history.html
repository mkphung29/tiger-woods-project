            on African-American golf history as opposed to Tiger's other 
            ethnicities such as Asian or Native American. This is because 
            Tiger Woods is predominantly presented on tours and in the media

                    <h2>Black Roles in a White-Dominated Sphere</h2>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            When golf was first introduced to America from the 
                            United Kingdom in the 18th century, it became another social 
                            sphere where black slaves fulfilled subservient roles to white 
                            men, laying the foundation for an elitist white culture within the sport.</p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            As golf began to grow in popularity especially in the South, slaves were 
                            most likely used to provide assistance to players on the course or build 
                            and maintain golf courses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            It wasn't until the 1880's where African-American men began to become more 
                            involved in the game and their participation increased.

                            <h2>Caddying</h2>
                            <p>Most black Americans that took up golf in the 19th 
                                and 20th centuries were first introduced to the game 
                                through caddying, carrying golf bags, cleaning clubs, 
                                and spotting balls for white players. White golfers 
                                and golf clubs found caddying a "suitable endeavor" 
                                for young black boys, reflecting traditional racial 
                                and class roles dominant in society and popularizing 
                                the trope of the black caddy boy in American popular 
                                culture. Soon, courses began to desire black caddies 
                                to hire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While caddying was a niche industry that allowed black 
                                men to have a specialized stream of income, black men 
                                were able to use their caddying positions to practice 
                                at courses (usually to the blind eye of the white 
                                players and staff) to learn and play the game. Caddying 
                                "complicated racial dynamics" between white players and 
                                black caddies, with relationships ranging from "demeaning 
                                abuse", "racist patronizing", or "genuine friendship."
                                Whatever the relationship may be, the racialized role of 
                                caddies solidifed the elitist image of golf, both dissuading 
                                and encouraging black men to learn the game.

                            <p class="black-labor">
                                There was a reliance on black labor to build and maintain golf
                                 facilities, especially in the South. In the clubhouse, subservient
                                  roles for black people were common, assuming jobs such as attendants,
                                   stewards, and chefs. Because the segregation in the white-dominated 
                                   sphere of golf drew a line between the privileges of the white 
                                   club-goers who enjoyed the facilities and the limitations of 
                                   African-Americans who had to maintain this space, black golfers sought
                                    to establish their own golfing spaces. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="black-labor">
                                The image above is shows members of America's first African-American golf 
                                club, Shady Rest Country Club, in Westfield, New Jersey in 1925. Black-owned
                                 and operated golf clubs began to appear across the country, mostly in the 
                                 Northeast and Midwest regions. Those critical of golf's elitist origins argued
                                  that with the creation of black-owned golf courses has led to these clubs to 
                                  reflecting the classist attitudes within the black community. Educator Elise 
                                  McDougald notes how "golf and clubs like Shady Rest offered Harlem's elite women
                                   social standing with whites while isolating them from the city's other black women."
                                   This gives way to formation of golf's respectability aspect, where elitist attitudes
                                    are utilized to reconcile with the permittance of black people into golf.

                            <h2>Black Erasure: The First Golf Tee</h2>
                            <p>
                                The erasure of African-American stories, achievements, and presence within golf is
                                 prominent, due to the upkeep of golf's white elitist image by historians or the media.
                                  One such case is the invention of the modern golf tee, created by a black dentist named
                                   George Franklin Grant from New Jersey in 1899. Grant's 1899 patent was the first one 
                                   for the golf tee, which resembles the wooden tee used by golfers since the 1940's. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet, organizations and publications such as the United States Golf Association (USGA) and
                                 Golf Digest credit William Lowell, a white dentist, with inventing the wooden tee in 1924.
                                  Crediting Grant would not fit the traditional narrative of golf's exclusively white origins,
                                   highlighting the importance of the game's racial exclusion over classist views, given that 
                                   Grant and Lowell were both affluent, Northeastern dentists. Much of golf's lore rests on its
                                ability to perpetuate its preceived exclusive status, but it only extends to the white experience.

                            <p>
                                Pictured above is the Pinehurst No. 2 course in North Carolina, which is considered one of the most
                                 historic courses in America. It's one of the first courses to feature Bermuda grass, which itself 
                                 as a racialized history. Bermuda grass does not originate from Bermuda but rather in Africa, where 
                                 it is cultivated as pasture grass.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Demas points out:
                            </p>
                            <p class="demas-quote">
                                "There is even evidence that slave owners identified Africans as more experienced in tending African-derived
                                 flora and fauna, including Bermuda grass. It became the most popular turf in the South and was used at 
                                 Augusta National."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, 40% of all courses in America feature Bermuda grass. The origins of the term 'Bermuda' grass point to
                                 how deep America's racism is entrenched in golf and also emphasizes how white prestige and traditionalism can
                                  mask its racist beginnings and narratives.
