                    <p class="roles-info">
                            When golf was first introduced to America from the 
                            United Kingdom in the 18th century, it became another social 
                            sphere where black slaves fulfilled subservient roles to white 
                            men, laying the foundation for an elitist white culture within the sport.</p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            As golf began to grow in popularity especially in the South, slaves were 
                            most likely used to provide assistance to players on the course or build 
                            and maintain golf courses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            It wasn't until the 1880's where African-American men began to become more 
                            involved in the game and their participation increased.

                            <h2>Caddying</h2>
                            <p>Most black Americans that took up golf in the 19th 
                                and 20th centuries were first introduced to the game 
                                through caddying, carrying golf bags, cleaning clubs, 
                                and spotting balls for white players. White golfers 
                                and golf clubs found caddying a "suitable endeavor" 
                                for young black boys, reflecting traditional racial 
                                and class roles dominant in society and popularizing 
                                the trope of the black caddy boy in American popular 
                                culture. Soon, courses began to desire black caddies 
                                to hire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While caddying was a niche industry that allowed black 
                                men to have a specialized stream of income, black men 
                                were able to use their caddying positions to practice 
                                at courses (usually to the blind eye of the white 
                                players and staff) to learn and play the game. Caddying 
                                "complicated racial dynamics" between white players and 
                                black caddies, with relationships ranging from "demeaning 
                                abuse", "racist patronizing", or "genuine friendship."
                                Whatever the relationship may be, the racialized role of 
                                caddies solidifed the elitist image of golf, both dissuading 
                                and encouraging black men to learn the game.

                            <p class="black-labor">
                                There was a reliance on black labor to build and maintain golf
                                 facilities, especially in the South. In the clubhouse, subservient
                                  roles for black people were common, assuming jobs such as attendants,
                                   stewards, and chefs. Because the segregation in the white-dominated 
                                   sphere of golf drew a line between the privileges of the white 
                                   club-goers who enjoyed the facilities and the limitations of 
                                   African-Americans who had to maintain this space, black golfers sought
                                    to establish their own golfing spaces. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="black-labor">
                                The image above is shows members of America's first African-American golf 
                                club, Shady Rest Country Club, in Westfield, New Jersey in 1925. Black-owned
                                 and operated golf clubs began to appear across the country, mostly in the 
                                 Northeast and Midwest regions. Those critical of golf's elitist origins argued
                                  that with the creation of black-owned golf courses has led to these clubs to 
                                  reflecting the classist attitudes within the black community. Educator Elise 
                                  McDougald notes how "golf and clubs like Shady Rest offered Harlem's elite women
                                   social standing with whites while isolating them from the city's other black women."
                                   This gives way to formation of golf's respectability aspect, where elitist attitudes
                                    are utilized to reconcile with the permittance of black people into golf.

                            <p>
                                The erasure of African-American stories, achievements, and presence within golf is
                                 prominent, due to the upkeep of golf's white elitist image by historians or the media.
                                  One such case is the invention of the modern golf tee, created by a black dentist named
                                   George Franklin Grant from New Jersey in 1899. Grant's 1899 patent was the first one 
                                   for the golf tee, which resembles the wooden tee used by golfers since the 1940's. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet, organizations and publications such as the United States Golf Association (USGA) and
                                 Golf Digest credit William Lowell, a white dentist, with inventing the wooden tee in 1924.
                                  Crediting Grant would not fit the traditional narrative of golf's exclusively white origins,
                                   highlighting the importance of the game's racial exclusion over classist views, given that 
                                   Grant and Lowell were both affluent, Northeastern dentists. Much of golf's lore rests on its
                                ability to perpetuate its preceived exclusive status, but it only extends to the white experience.

                                Pictured above is the Pinehurst No. 2 course in North Carolina, which is considered one of the most
                                 historic courses in America. It's one of the first courses to feature Bermuda grass, which itself 
                                 as a racialized history. Bermuda grass does not originate from Bermuda but rather in Africa, where 
                                 it is cultivated as pasture grass.

                                "There is even evidence that slave owners identified Africans as more experienced in tending African-derived
                                 flora and fauna, including Bermuda grass. It became the most popular turf in the South and was used at

                                Today, 40% of all courses in America feature Bermuda grass. The origins of the term 'Bermuda' grass point to
                                 how deep America's racism is entrenched in golf and also emphasizes how white prestige and traditionalism can
                                  mask its racist beginnings and narratives.

            <h2>Those Who Came Before Tiger: The Black Pioneers</h2>
            <p>Tiger Woods would not have been able to become the face of black golf 
                community without the black pioneers before him paving the way for 
                greater racial inclusion in the game. Black golfing stars such as 
                Charlie Sifford and Bill Spiller encouraged greater diversity within 
                the game while challenging golf's white exclusivity and elitism. First
                 competing on the only black tour in the US, the United Golf Association (UGA),
                  they helped change golf's meaning in American culture, presenting a fundamentally 
                  different vision of professional golf. By popularizing golf through the creation 
                  of their own prestige on the UGA tour, the black pioneers attracted various kinds 
                  of fans and spectators, with different racial makeups (black and white) and classes, 
                  diverging from the usual upper-class fanbase of white golf. Introduced to golf through 
                  caddying, these black golfers challenged white player tropes and black stereotypes, 
                  contributed to fashion styles and modern golfing etiquette, and became local heroes 
                  to their communities.<br>
                <br>But there's a reason why the black pioneers were not championed like Tiger. Despite 
                their contributions to integration in golf and ending blatant racial discriminatory 
                attitudes towards black players, players like Howard Wheeler and Bill Spiller are erased 
                in golf's racial history. The visibility that Tiger gave to the black golf community is 
                very different the ways the black pioneers directly confronted golf's racism and elitism. 
                While the black pioneers forced America to acknowledge their blackness and confront its 
                racial issues, Tiger gave America an excuse to turn colorblind, allowing for the disregard 
                of implicit racial biases still ingrained in golf's culture today.

            <h2>Collision of the White and Black Golf Worlds</h2>
            <p>The participation of black players in a sport with strong class and racial connotations like
                 golf was debated between supporters who celebrated and encouraged black golf and opponents
                  who viewed it as the negative appropriation of golf as the ultimate symbol of white privilege.<br>
                <br>During the Harlem Renaissance, W.E.B. Du Boi praised the symbolism of black Americans taking
                 up golf but also asserted that golf was "a little more than elite, conspicuous consumption for
                  whites and a false sense of security for blacks"1. Most African-Americans who played substantial
                   golf tended to be relatively wealthy, with their golfing endeavors celebrated as "examples of
                    socioeconomic uplift"1.  Thus, black golfers were criticized as being out-of-touch with the
                     economic and racial reality faced by most black Americans. On the other hand, African-American
                    golfers embraced a 'respectability' stance in order to fit in with the white golf culture, which
                       allowed their white counterparts and fans to become open to integration. But, this was only
                        because black golfers were viewed as "respectable" thanks to either their skill, achievements,
                         or class, not because they believed racial discrimination to be wrong. In 1929, journalist H.L.
                          Mencken warned that black golf did not represent advancement and opportunity, arguing that instead,
                           it typified an increasingly disjointed black community, with out-of-touch black elites who led lives
                            of "easy contentment, of antinomian opportunism, of well-fed complacency, of black Babbitry"<br>
                <br>Further, golf was used to stigmatize whites and criticize white leadership. The sport was played by prominent
                 white political leaders, including US presidents, who supported segregation or did not take action against it.
                  Some people in the black community felt too alienated by golf's elitism to support the game.<br>
                <br>Those who supported black participation were optimistic that golf would lead to further black advancement
                 and successfully challenge segregation in sports and in society. There was something radical about the symbolism
                  of a black man playing golf that gave supporters hope that black people would be welcomed in all spaces, even ones
                   that are dominated by white prestige. The integration of the PGA Tour and the Masters tournament challenged the
                    notion that golf was the bastion of white privilege.<br>
                <br>Lee Elder's first Masters appearance and the inclusion of a greater number of African-Americans in PGA Tour events
                 gave rise to a new political climate within the golfing world, one aligned with colorblindness and post-racial America.
                  When Tiger Woods became introduced to the world, many viewed him as the pinnacle of black golf, the face of a new wave
                   of black golfers ready to change the game. Yet, the racial biases instilled within golf were still prevalent, and Americans
                    were ready and willing to accept Tiger to fit golf's traditional white, elitist narrative while proclaiming him as evidence
                     of golf's great progress.

            <h2>Two Black Golfers, Different Representation</h2>
            <p>The juxtaposition between Woods's and Peete's vastly different backgrounds highlights how golf's elitist narratives are selective in choosing its
                 black representation in its racial history. Yes, while Woods's success far surpasses (though does not diminishes) Peete's success, the success
                  of black golfers did not start with Woods, but a substantial part of America's fixation on him has much to do with his middle-class background
                   and how it better aligns with golf's racial narratives over Peete's difficult upbringing. With all of Peete's own strong success on the tour,
                    Demas argues that Peete's career, not Woods's, marks the pinnacle of black golf in American history, with black engagement in the game peaking
                     in the 1970's and 1980's.<br>
                <br>The lack of recognition surrounding Peete's career has more to do with what he symbolizes to the game of golf. Basically the antithesis of white
                 elitism, Peete's working class background threatens the exclusivity lure of the sport by dismantling stereotypes of golf being a game for the privileged
                  and higher status. Thus, his path to success was overlooked, and with his older age, mangled arm, and fully black heritage, he was not someone deemed
                   worthy of representing a black community that can uphold golf's elitist narrative. The golfing world (the tours, media, fans) sought to construct an
                    alternative version of black golf that maintains the illusion of golf's prestige through colorblind narratives. Therefore, Tiger was fitting because
                     he was young and attractive, clearly successful, and perpetuated a higher status image approved by the golfing world.

                        <p>Understanding golf's racial origins is crucial to comprehending the political and social climate of the sport when Tiger Woods arrives
                             on the PGA Tour. The influence of the white establishment in golf is uniquely connected to hierarchical class structures in society,
                              and the power structures that maintain white superiority in golf depend on sustaining an elitist culture and perception.<br>
                            <br>The classes and race of golf's black pioneers challenge this perception, and after resisting the increasing visibility of black
                             golfers and taking actions to prevent their success, golf's most powerful institutions adopted ideals of respectability and placed
                              these ideals on black golfers so golf's prestige wouldn't be challenged. Since African-American golfers had  accomplishments and
                               showed respectable ideals, their presence in professional golf would be tolerated by the elite.<br>
                            <br>Reaching a point where blatant racial discrimination is no longer accepted in society's moral standards, the timing of Tiger's
                             introduction into the world of golf was a relief to golf's establishment, who wanted to improve golf's image to the general public
                              as a progressive sport while maintaining its white elitism. Tiger Woods proved to be an excellent candidate as the face of golf's
                               progress, with a background that complements golf's emphasis on class and diverging from the black troupes of subservience and low
                                status. In declaring Tiger its champion for golf's racial progress, the white establishment of golf  found someone who can help its
                                 desire to erase black struggles in the games history and congratulate itself for its moral virtues.
