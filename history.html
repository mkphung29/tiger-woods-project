            Disclaimer: When reviewing golf's racial history, my analysis focuses 
            on African-American golf history as opposed to Tiger's other 
            ethnicities such as Asian or Native American. This is because 
            Tiger Woods is predominantly presented on tours and in the media 
            as a black golfer (*the erasure of his Asian and American Indian 
            identities will be explored in a different section*)

                    <h2>Black Roles in a White-Dominated Sphere</h2>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            When golf was first introduced to America from the 
                            United Kingdom in the 18th century, it became another social 
                            sphere where black slaves fulfilled subservient roles to white 
                            men, laying the foundation for an elitist white culture within the sport.</p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            As golf began to grow in popularity especially in the South, slaves were 
                            most likely used to provide assistance to players on the course or build 
                            and maintain golf courses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="roles-info">
                            It wasn't until the 1880's where African-American men began to become more 
                            involved in the game and their participation increased.
