            <h2>Woods as an Icon</h2>
            <p>Tiger Woods's impact on golf cannot be understated. After winning 
                the 1997 Masters tournament, Woods shot up to national superstardom 
                and became a symbol of promise for racial progress in America. 
                His arrival on the PGA Tour generated expectations for and hope 
                for increased diversity in professional golf, especially from 
                non-white communities. A non-white man dominating a traditionally 
                white, elitist sport was an incredibly powerful image for American 
                politics and culture.

            <h2>Controversies</h2>
            <p>Yet this promise of a change in America's racial politics did not 
                happen. Tiger Woods would not be an outspoken voice against 
                America's racial issues and disappointed many non-white people with 
                his reluctance to make firm political stances.

            <h2>Thesis</h2>
            <p>Through his assimilation into golf's white elitism and the 
                problematic manipulation of his multiracial background, Tiger Woods 
                upholds white prestige in American sports, culture, and politics to 
                further his career and wealth and perpetuate an illusion of progress
                 instead of becoming a voice for racial change in America.
