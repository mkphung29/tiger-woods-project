            <h2>Where are the Black Golfers Today?</h2>
            <p>
                Many people anticipated a great new wave of
                 African-American golfers after Tiger won the 1997
                  Masters, but the PGA Tour remains white-dominated
                   and contains even fewer black golfers today than 
                   in the past. Even though a larger number of
                    African-Americans are granted access to the game,
                     a majority of black golfers seldom make it to the
                      tour and play on an elite level as Woods.

                    <h2>The Decline of African-Americans in Golf</h2>
                    <p>
                        The decline of African-Americans playing at
                         the elite level reflects a broader loss of access
                          to the game due to growing racial discrepancies
                           in wealth and the deterioration of predominantly
                            black neighborhoods.<br>
                        <br>While the total number of black players continued
                         to grow, their overall ratio on the PGA Tour declined.1
                          The National Golf Foundation (NGF) reported that 649,000
                           black golfers were actively playing in 1990, up from
                            360,000 four years earlier. However, at the same time,
                             ratio of black golfers to the national percentage was
                              declining, with African-American golfers constituting
                               just 2.3% of players in the U.S.<br>
                        <br>Due to the growing racial discrepancies in wealth, the
                         decline of golf highlighted the inaction towards "rising
                          crime", "urban decline", and "racial unrest"1 , which in
                           turn, make it more difficult to establish youth programs
                            to cultivate the next generation of black golfers.<br>
                        <br>Another important aspect to raise is that the decline
                         of black golfers correlates with the decline of black caddies.
                          Caddying became one of the most effective ways for young
                           black children to get involved into the game and start
                            playing. But with the invention of the golf cart and 
                            with golf courses beginning to employ fewer full-time
                             caddies, the popularity of caddying decreased. As soon
                              as PGA Tour players started to hire their own personal
                               caddies who traveled alongside them, there was a shift
                                from black caddies to white caddies because the job
                                 became more "lucrative" and "respected."1 Thus, the
                                  appropriation of caddying by white folks signifies
                                   the end of caddying as a means to enforce racial
                                    and class divisions within the sport. Now, the
                                     status from caddying reflects the white elitist
                                      nature of the game and white caddies are allowed
                                       to be compensated more for being white.

            <h2>Lack of Diversity:</h2>
            <p>
                Diversity on the PGA Tour has actually regressed since the
                 arrival of Tiger Woods. As of April 8, 2022, there are only
                  four Black golfers with full PGA membership, including Tiger
                   Woods, Harold Varner III, Cameron Champ, and Joseph Bramlett,
                    which makes up only 1.5% of the whole tour.8<br>
                <br>Race and class intersect in ways that reflect the racial
                 makeup of the tour and the broad class struggles of different
                  racial communities in America. According to Demas, "money remains
                   perhaps the biggest obstacle to minority golf advancement"1,
                    where performance standards increase yearly as does the prices
                     for equipment, instruction, course membership, and tournament
                      expenses. Because of how race and class structures overlap
                      in the US, many people in the black, Latino, and Native American
                       communities don't have the funds to access resources crucial
                        to early golf development and the chance at turning pro. Many
                         Asian-Americans do have the resources, which correlates with
                          the growing number of Asian-American representation on
                           professional tours for both men and women. <br>
                    <br>But the golf establishment continues to remain predominantly
                    white and privileged. In 2020, 82% of all golfers in America were
                     white while 25% of junior golfers (aged 6-17) were non-white.9

               <h3>Tiger's Response to the BLM Movement:</h3>
               <p>
                In 2020, after much speculation on whether or not Tiger
                 will respond to George Floyd's death, Woods released a 
                 statement on Twitter that attempted to acknowledge both
                  sides of the issue but contradicts himself. While
                  condemning the police brutality involved in Floyd's
                   death, Tiger also makes a point to voice his support
                    for law enforcement, and by extension, the same
                     institutionalized systems that the Black Lives Matter
                      movement wants to dismantle. During a time so
                       politically-charged and polarizing, Tiger's attempt
                        to retain a somewhat neutral stance on the issue
                         is consistent with the ways in which he sidesteps
                          deeper conversations about the role white institutions
                           play in enforcing racial and class struggles across
                            the country.<br>
                <br>The statement's most controversial line, "we can make our
                 points without burning the very neighborhoods that we live in",
                  indicates that white establishment thinking still influences Tiger's
                   PR approach to racial issues and provides evidence of him trying
                    to separate himself from the hooliganism and criminality stereotypes
                     that BLM opponents use to commonly characterize the movement.
                      Overall, Tiger wants to be seen as a supporter of change without
                       being alienated from the white establishment, an establishment 
                       that still greatly influences the golf world today.

                        Numerous online articles reporting on Tiger's comments
                         about BLM repeatedly point out Tiger's history of avoiding
                          critical discussions about racial issues.<br>
                        <br>For example, the news outlet BET (Black Entertainment
                         Television) released an article with a subtitle, "The golf
                          icon makes a rare statement about social justice", further
                           mentioning that he "is not known for his bold political
                            commentary."10 The article mentions another statement
                             Tiger made about the BLM movement:<br>
                        <!--italicize below-->
                        <br>"I think change is fantastic but as long as we make changes
                         without hurting the innocent...Unfortunately that has happened.
                          Hopefully, that doesn't happen in the future but a movement
                           and change is fantastic."<br>
                        <br>In a subtle dig at Woods, BET writes, "it's not clear who
                         Tiger is referring to when he says 'hurting the innocent.'"
                          Based on Tiger's previous Twitter statement, it can be assumed
                           that he is criticizing black militancy. The article's
                            slightly judgmental tone is used to expose the hypocrisy
                             of Tiger's inability to reflect deeper on racial issues
                              and lead change while he criticizes the actions taken
                               by others for change. <br>
                        <br>In another web article titled, "Tiger Woods is Irrelevant
                         to Black Lives Matter", Civil Rights Activist Dr. Harry Edwards
                          scorns the idea of Tiger as a productive voice for racial
                           movements: <br>
                        <!--italicize below-->
                        <br>"I've talked to him in the past. I have talked to Tiger in
                         the past and I haven't heard anything from him. I am not 
                         looking at anything from him...As far as I am concerned, 
                         with this movement he is irrelevant. I think that we should 
                         just move on...I mean, there is nothing there that is going 
                         to have an impact. Nothing that he could say would be 
                         believable, nothing that he could do would be creditable, 
                         nothing that he could contribute would be worth very much."<br>
                        <br>Opposite of the post-racial narrative that Tiger was the
                         catalyst for racial change in America, Edwards rejects the 
                         idea of Tiger being a voice and symbol of the black community.
                          Further, the article mentions that many black people feel 
                          particularly alienated by Tiger's decision to accept honors
                           from President Donald Trump. With the emergence of athletes
                            such as LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul who
                             have all used their platforms to directly speak out 
                             against racial issues in America, black people have 
                             found other athletes to be better activists for their
                              community instead of Tiger's adherence to a colorblind
                               vision of America.11

                        <p>Tiger Woods was supposed to be the first of a new generation of
                             non-white professional golfers promised to diversify the tour,
                              but recent evidence of the decline of African-Americans in 
                              professional golf coupled with the lack of diversity among
                               young golfers shows that this was not the case. Much of the
                                reason there was no substantial racial change in golf is 
                                because Tiger used his success to fortify underlying racial
                                 biases within golf's white elitist culture to promote his 
                                 brand ambitions rather than utilizing his success as a 
                                 platform to urge social change.<br>
                            <br>Obsessed with maintaining an appealing image for white America,
                             Woods's economic status relied on the conservation of the wealthy
                              white class that fuels sponsorships, provides a target consumer
                               base, and decides who is worthy of visibility on tour. It probably
                                wasn't Tiger's conscious intention to uphold white prestige in 
                                golf, but becoming the face of racial progress while attempting
                                 to reach the highest levels of personal success is difficult when
                                  the lines are blurred between politics, class, and race in golf's
                                   institutionalized structure. It is also considerable to note that
                                    the racial conversations happening during Tiger's peak years is
                                     very different from the conversations happening today and how
                                      black activism is becoming more vocal.<br>
                            <br>However, this doesn't take away from the achievements he made and what
                             they mean for non-white communities who hope to see more representation on
                              tour. Tiger is widely considered the face of modern golf, which makes it
                               all the more powerful as a non-white leader in a traditionally white space.
                                Tiger may not have been the person to enact major racial progress, but his
